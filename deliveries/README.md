This directory has configuration files for building docker images,
and management files for starting and stopping docker containers.

The Apps_Users_OnBoarding_Script.sql file has data for ONAP demo deployments:
it adds users and applications so the Portal app has meaningful content on
startup.  These were moved from script EcompPortalDMLMySql_1707_OS.sql.
