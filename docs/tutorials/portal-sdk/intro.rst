Introduction
============

In this tutorial you'll be creating your own ONAP Portal SDK web application, starting with pulling the source code directly from ONAP's Portal SDK Gerrit repository.

Your new web application will use the various frameworks that are included in the Portal SDK to display a simple but interactive application page that will let a user choose from two different charts to display.

To do this, you'll learn how to setup and query a database in the backend as well as populate chart data for displaying.
